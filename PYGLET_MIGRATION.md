# Pyglet Migration Guide

## Overview

This document explains the migration from Pygame to Pyglet for the Tetris game, highlighting the benefits and differences between the two implementations.

## Why Pyglet?

### Performance Advantages

1. **OpenGL Acceleration**: Pyglet uses OpenGL directly, providing hardware-accelerated graphics <mcreference link="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-pyglet-and-pygame-in-python/" index="1">1</mcreference>
2. **Better Rendering Performance**: Significantly faster rendering, especially for particle effects and animations <mcreference link="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-pyglet-and-pygame-in-python/" index="1">1</mcreference>
3. **Efficient Batch Rendering**: Pyglet's batch system allows drawing thousands of objects efficiently
4. **Native 3D Support**: While our Tetris is 2D, Pyglet's 3D capabilities allow for advanced visual effects <mcreference link="https://externlabs.com/blogs/differences-between-pyglet-vs-pygame/" index="4">4</mcreference>

### Visual Effects Improvements

1. **Advanced Particle Systems**: 
   - Explosion effects with realistic physics
   - Sparkle effects with alpha blending
   - Smooth particle animations with gravity

2. **Better Alpha Blending**: 
   - Transparent effects
   - Fade-in/fade-out animations
   - Layered visual elements

3. **Smooth Animations**:
   - 60 FPS rendering with consistent frame timing
   - Interpolated movements
   - Pulsing and twinkling effects

### Code Architecture Benefits

1. **Pure Python**: No external dependencies beyond Pyglet itself <mcreference link="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-pyglet-and-pygame-in-python/" index="1">1</mcreference>
2. **Event-Driven Architecture**: More natural game loop structure
3. **Modular Design**: Cleaner separation of rendering, effects, and game logic

## File Structure Comparison

### Original Pygame Implementation
```
src/tetris/
├── game.py              # Main game logic with Pygame
├── renderer.py          # Pygame-based rendering
├── effects.py           # Basic effects with Pygame drawing
└── ...
```

### New Pyglet Implementation
```
src/tetris/
├── pyglet_game.py       # Main game logic with Pyglet
├── pyglet_renderer.py   # OpenGL-accelerated rendering
├── pyglet_effects.py    # Advanced particle effects
├── game.py              # Original Pygame version (preserved)
├── renderer.py          # Original Pygame renderer (preserved)
├── effects.py           # Original Pygame effects (preserved)

```

## Key Differences

### Coordinate System
- **Pygame**: Origin (0,0) at top-left, Y increases downward
- **Pyglet**: Origin (0,0) at bottom-left, Y increases upward (OpenGL standard)

### Rendering Approach
- **Pygame**: Immediate mode rendering, draw each frame completely
- **Pyglet**: Batch rendering with retained graphics objects

### Event Handling
- **Pygame**: Poll events in main loop
- **Pyglet**: Event-driven callbacks

### Performance Characteristics
- **Pygame**: CPU-based rendering, suitable for simple 2D games
- **Pyglet**: GPU-accelerated rendering, better for complex visual effects <mcreference link="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/differences-between-pyglet-and-pygame-in-python/" index="1">1</mcreference>

## Enhanced Features in Pyglet Version

### 1. Advanced Particle Effects

#### Explosion Effects
- Particles radiate outward from cleared lines
- Realistic physics with gravity
- Color variations and size changes
- Fade-out over time

#### Sparkle Effects
- Twinkling particles when pieces land
- Gentle floating motion
- Multiple sparkle colors
- Continuous spawning during effect duration

#### Line Flash Effects
- Pulsing white flash on cleared lines
- Smooth alpha transitions
- Synchronized with particle effects

### 2. Improved Visual Quality

#### Ghost Piece
- Semi-transparent preview of piece landing position
- Smooth alpha blending
- Real-time position updates

#### UI Enhancements
- Crisp text rendering
- Better color schemes
- Smooth transitions

#### Level Up Effects
- Celebratory particle bursts
- Multiple colored explosions
- Radial pattern animations

### 3. Performance Optimizations

#### Batch Rendering
- All similar objects rendered in single draw call
- Reduced CPU-GPU communication
- Better frame rate consistency

#### Efficient Memory Usage
- Reusable graphics objects
- Automatic cleanup of expired effects
- Optimized particle management

## Running the Pyglet Version

### Installation
```bash
# Install Pyglet dependency
pip install pyglet>=2.0.0

# Or install all dependencies
pip install -e .
```

### Execution
```bash
# Run Pyglet version
python main_pyglet.py

# Run original Pygame version
python main.py
```

### Controls
Both versions use the same controls:
- **Arrow Keys**: Move and rotate pieces
- **Space**: Hard drop
- **P**: Pause/unpause
- **R**: Restart (when game over)
- **ESC**: Quit

## Migration Benefits Summary

| Feature | Pygame Version | Pyglet Version |
|---------|----------------|----------------|
| **Performance** | CPU-based, slower | GPU-accelerated, faster |
| **Visual Effects** | Basic shapes | Advanced particles |
| **Transparency** | Limited support | Full alpha blending |
| **Animations** | Simple | Smooth and complex |
| **Code Complexity** | Moderate | Well-structured |
| **Dependencies** | Pygame only | Pyglet only |
| **3D Capability** | None | Full 3D support |
| **Particle Count** | Limited | Thousands possible |

## Future Enhancements

With the Pyglet foundation, future improvements could include:

1. **3D Effects**: 
   - Rotating pieces in 3D space
   - Depth-based particle systems
   - 3D board visualization

2. **Advanced Shaders**:
   - Custom fragment shaders for effects
   - Post-processing effects

   - Interactive elements

## Conclusion

The Pyglet implementation provides a significant upgrade in visual quality and performance while maintaining the same gameplay experience. The modular architecture makes it easy to extend with new features and effects, positioning the game for future enhancements that wouldn't be practical with the Pygame version.

Both versions are maintained in the codebase, allowing users to choose based on their preferences and system capabilities.
